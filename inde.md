The first page is the Landing page as shown in the picture above.  This is an introductory page that tells you what you need to know about the application you are signing up for.  
Should you choose to create an account or login, it will then take you to the home page that looks exactly like the landing page except there will now be option in the top menu.  
The first tab is "Add Contact".  This will allow you to add a person's information into the database.  To view this contact, you can click on the "List Contacts" tab.  
If you accidentally see you have made a mistake, then you press the edit option on the contact card.  You can also place a side note attached to the contact in the bottom portion of the contact card.  It will show you your note along with a time stamp.
The admin page will have the same exact properties, but it will have one extra tab called "admin".  This tab will show all contacts in the system and will show who the owner is.
